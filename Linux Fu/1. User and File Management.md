## Read, Write, Execute

Each file has a set of permission for specific user and user groups. As showwn above, the read, write, execute permissions are _octet_ values set by kernel to each file and directory.
- After deciding what should be a file's permission across the users and groups, we can set  such as:
  - A text file dont need to be 'executable' and have read and write permissions `-rw-r--r--` i.e. _644_; Meaning read and write for the user, only read permission for other users in the same group and only read permission for everyone 'execept the user and group the user is in'.
> `-rwx------` This file is read/write/execute for the owner only.</br>
> `dr-xr-x---` This directory is read/execute for the owner and the group.
> `-rwxr-xr-x` This file is read/write/execute for the owner, and read/execute for the group and others. 

### Typical File Permissions:
| Octet Values | Permissions | |
|---|---|---|
|711| rwx--x--x| Used shells scripts.sh|
|644| rw-r--r--| Text files|
|755| rwx-r-xr-x| Only user has write priv.|
