Each file has a set of permission for specific user and user groups. As showwn above, the read, write, execute permissions are _octet_ values set by kernel to each file and directory.
- After deciding what should be a file's permission across the users and groups, the kernel set the permissions such as:
- A text file dont need to be 'executable' and have read and write permissions `-rw-r--r--` i.e. _644_; Meaning read and write for the user, only read permission for other users in the same group and only read permission for everyone 'execept the user and group the user is in'.
